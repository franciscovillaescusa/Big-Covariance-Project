Scripts:

1) covariance.py --> script to compute the covariance matrix and the
   		     derivatives of the observables with respect to 
		     the cosmological parameters

2) fisher.py ------> script to compute the Fisher matrix of a single
   	     	     observable or a combination of them. It requires
		     the having computed the covariance matrix and the
		     derivatives of the parameters


Libraries:

1) BCP_library.py -> python library with different routines needed to
   		     compute the Fisher matrix for the numerical and
		     analytic approaches
